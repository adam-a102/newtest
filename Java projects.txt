Great question â€” if youâ€™re learning **Java** and want to practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, working on small projects is the best way to solidify your understanding of **classes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction**.

Hereâ€™s a list of **beginner-friendly OOP projects** (ranging from easy to moderate) â€” all in **Java**:

---

### ðŸŸ¢ **Level 1: Fundamentals**

These will help you practice basic OOP structure â€” classes, objects, and simple interactions.

1. **Student Management System**

   * **Concepts:** Classes, objects, lists, encapsulation.
   * **Description:** Create classes like `Student`, `Course`, and `Grade`. Allow adding/removing students and assigning grades.
   * **Bonus:** Save/load data from a text file.

2. **Bank Account Simulator**

   * **Concepts:** Encapsulation, methods, constructors.
   * **Description:** Model a `BankAccount` class with methods like `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `checkBalance()`.
   * **Bonus:** Add `SavingsAccount` and `CheckingAccount` classes using **inheritance**.

3. **Library System**

   * **Concepts:** Classes, collections, relationships between objects.
   * **Description:** Create `Book` and `Library` classes to add, remove, and search for books.
   * **Bonus:** Add a `Member` class that can borrow/return books.

### ðŸŸ¡ **Level 2: Intermediate OOP**

Now youâ€™ll incorporate inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.

4. **Shape Calculator**

   * **Concepts:** Inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction.
   * **Description:** Create an abstract class `Shape` with subclasses like `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle`. Each should have methods to calculate area and perimeter.
   * **Bonus:** Implement a menu-driven console app to choose a shape and calculate its properties.

5. **Online Shopping Cart**

   * **Concepts:** Classes, aggregation, inheritance.
   * **Description:** Classes: `Product`, `Cart`, `Customer`. Add and remove items, calculate total cost.
   * **Bonus:** Include discounts or promo codes using **interfaces**.

6. **Simple ATM System**

   * **Concepts:** Encapsulation, user input, exception handling.
   * **Description:** Simulate an ATM that allows a user to check balance, withdraw, and deposit.
   * **Bonus:** Add multiple users and a simple authentication system.

### ðŸ”µ **Level 3: Slightly Larger Projects**

These are more integrated and show real-world OOP design.

7. **Hotel Reservation System**

   * **Concepts:** Relationships between objects, file I/O.
   * **Description:** Manage `Room`, `Reservation`, and `Customer` classes. Handle check-in/check-out and room availability.
   * **Bonus:** Save reservations to a file or use a simple database (like SQLite).

8. **Vehicle Rental System**

   * **Concepts:** Inheritance, polymorphism.
   * **Description:** Classes like `Vehicle`, `Car`, `Bike`, `Truck`, and `Rental`.
   * **Bonus:** Add pricing rules depending on vehicle type and rental duration.

9. **Task Manager / To-Do App**

   * **Concepts:** Encapsulation, interfaces, file handling.
   * **Description:** Create `Task` and `TaskList` classes to manage and persist user tasks.
   * **Bonus:** Use JavaFX or Swing for a simple GUI.

---

### ðŸ’¡ **Optional GUI or API Extensions**

Once youâ€™re comfortable with OOP basics, you can:

* Use **JavaFX** or **Swing** to build graphical interfaces.
* Add a **REST API** using **Spring Boot** to turn one of these projects into a small web app.

Would you like me to **pick one project** (e.g., the *Bank Account Simulator*) and walk you through a **step-by-step guide** (structure, UML, and sample code)?
